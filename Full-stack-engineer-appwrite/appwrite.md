# Appwrite Application

## Why I am a great fit

1. I have over 2 years of experience building full-stack web applications. This comes from my previous job as a frontend software engineer for a crypto trading company. I worked with React.js, Typescript, Node.js, PHP, Laravel, and Docker.

2. I understand how to work with different software and technologies from my long standing experience writing technical articles for different clients. I have worked extensively with technologies in the Javascript ecosystem like Javascript, Node.js, and Typescript. I have also explored the Rust and Go ecosystems and have built tools with these two system programming languages.

3. I can build SDKs and APIs for different frameworks and platforms. This comes from my innate love for trying out new technologies.

4. I have experience with community management from my time as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador. I was able to mentor other student ambassadors, non-ambassadors, and tech newbies.

5. I can write succint technical documentation for software tools and technologies. This experience comes from my different involvement in open-source contributions.

6. I write easy-to-follow technical articles to help developers learn new technologies. This comes from my 2+ years working as a contract technical writer for Draft.dev.

## Something interesting about me

I can do 60 pushups at a stretch and I take lounges for breakfast. I can fry eggs perfectly too.

On the technical side, I have combined my knowledge of robotics and Machine Learning to create an autonomous rover that can recognize objects in an environment.
